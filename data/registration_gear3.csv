So, a big yes! We must be concerned about it even much more than many other parts of the world.
In Nigeria, our concern should be much higher because we don‚Äôt have the systems and structures to cope with climate change impacts like some other countries.
Hence, our need to be very proactive to mitigate climate change as much as possible and also set up adaptation measures in areas where we already feel the impact.
