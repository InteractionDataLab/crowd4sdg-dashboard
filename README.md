# Crowd4SDG dashboard

Source code to reproduce the [dashboard](https://co-so.app/crowd4sdg-dashboard) used for the [Crowd4SDG](https://crowd4sdg.eu/) program evaluation.

Crowd4SDG is a Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Action supported by the European Commissionâ€™s Science with and for Society (SwafS) programme. Through an innovation cycle called GEAR (GATHER, EVALUATE, ACCELERATE, REFINE), the transdisciplinary Crowd4SDG consortium of six partners will promote the development of citizen science projects aimed at tackling the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),  with a focus on climate action.

The goal of the Crowd4SDG project is to research the extent to which Citizen Science (CS) can provide an essential source of non-traditional data for tracking progress towards the SDGs, as well as the ability of CS to generate social innovations that enable such progress. Based on shared expertise in crowdsourcing for disaster response, the transdisciplinary Crowd4SDG consortium of six partners will focus on SDG 13, Climate Action, to explore new ways of applying CS for monitoring the impacts of extreme climate events and strengthening the resilience of communities to climate-related disasters.

For evaluation purposes, we developed this software that takes as input survey results and Slack data from different phases of the program to create an interactive dashboard comparing these phases. The use case here is when, at the end of a program, a coordinator would want to evaluate different phases or different implementations of the programs in different settings. The code is in R and can be easily modified and adapted to custom purposes, that provides essential visualizations of geographical, network, qualitative and quantitative data.
